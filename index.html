              My Name is Will Huang and I have been a front-end web developer at Publicis Seattle for the past 4 years.  My main responsibility was building various html banner ads for T-Mobile and micro sites for KEXP.
              
              <br/><br/>

              My background is in animation.  I have a MFA in 3D Character Animation and I originally started at Publicis Seattle as flash motion designer.  It wasn't until flash became obsolete that I started learning HTML5 development on the job.

              <br/><br/>

              Ultimately, my goal is to become a full stack javascript developer and hopefully developing fun and engaging websites for game companies.
